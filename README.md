## Overview

This plugin adds support for the Monkey C bytecode format used by Garmin Connect IQ devices. It is designed to provide robust disassembly and static analysis capabilities, allowing reverse engineers to inspect classes, functions, and cross-references in `.prg` files.

**Note:** This plugin focuses on **Disassembly** and **Static Analysis**. It does not currently implement P-Code semantics for the Decompiler view.

You can read more about binary structure in the [research documentation](doc/prg.md)

## Features

* **Automatic Loader:** Automatically detects valid Monkey C (`.prg`) files and loads them into memory.
* **Class & Function Recovery:** Parses internal metadata to recreate Class structures and Function definitions in the Symbol Tree.
* **Symbol Table Resolution:**
  * Populates the Ghidra Symbol Table with internal function names.
  * Resolves Symbol IDs in the disassembly to their actual string names or values.
* **String Resolution:** Automatically maps string resource IDs to their actual string values in the listing.
* **Cross-References (XRefs):** Adds code and data cross-references to track usage of functions and fields.
* **Auto-Analysis:** The Monkey C Analyzer runs automatically after loading to apply these markups.

## Installation

### From Release (Recommended)

1. Download the latest release zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Gualdimar/MonkeyC-Ghidra-Plugin/releases) page.
2. Open Ghidra.
3. Go to **File** -> **Install Extensions**.
4. Click the green **+** icon.
5. Select the downloaded zip file.
6. Restart Ghidra.

### From Source

Prerequisites: Gradle and a valid Ghidra installation.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set the `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable to your Ghidra installation path.
3. Run the build command:

    ```bash
    gradle buildExtension
    ```

4. The output zip will be located in the `dist/` folder.
5. Install as described above.

## Usage

1. **Import File:** Drag and drop a `.prg` file into the Ghidra Project window.
2. **Select Format:** The loader will auto-detect "Monkey C". Click **OK**.
3. **Analyze:** When prompted, ensure the **Monkey C Analyzer** is checked (it is selected by default). Click **Analyze**.
4. **Inspect:**
    * Open the **Listing View** to see the disassembled bytecode with resolved names.
    * Open the **Symbol Tree** to explore recovered Classes and Functions.
    * Use **XRefs** (double-click or right-click) to navigate between function calls.

## Limitations

* **Disassembly Only:** The Decompiler window will show empty or raw output because P-Code semantics are not implemented. Please rely on the Listing window for analysis.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! If you find a `.prg` file that fails to load or have suggestions for better analysis, please open an issue.
